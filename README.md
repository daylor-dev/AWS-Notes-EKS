# AWS Notes: EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)



## ðŸ¤”About EKS



An EKS allows execution of Kubernetes on AWS without the need to install its own Kubernetes cluster. 



### Why EKS?

Managing Kubernetes alone is complex. Developers can use EKS to facilitate the orchestration without the need to manage Kubernetes cluster.



## ðŸ¤” About Kubernetes

Kubernetes helps adjust cluster size according to application demands.



### Some Important Things Kubernetes Does:

- Exposition of containers: Kubernetes helps expose a specific container by using its IP or DNS name.



- Load Balancer: if traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes distributes the network traffic to help deployments.



- Self-healing: if a container is not failing, Kubernetes replaces or kills this container and only advertises users until they are ready to be used again.



## ðŸ¤” About Pods

The smallest deployment unit managed by Kubernetes. It is a group of one or more containers.
